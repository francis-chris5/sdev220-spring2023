1.) copied over the display method from list we made monday
        * called that while reading the data file, and when processing payroll
        * the stack checks out pushing and popping
        
2.) noticed input in pop method had self.name, changed to top.name

3.) added an echo to make sure pay() was getting called with correct object from stack
        * it was, added in hours, correct value
        * added echoes at every step in pay() method
        ** values are there but it is returning none
        
        
    
*** new issues, still get none for all returns except sally (first in stack) then an attribute error on boss.next.next
        ** made while loop while boss.next != none
        ********** FIXED
        
4.) back to final none-type return, suddenly noticed there was not a return on the else structure
    ** this means that top of stack returns but it came from recursive call so all previous calls were returning none
    ** this explains why the last value worked
    *** removed echoes to finish up.
    *******************  FIXED

** added in the empID field we forgot in the output
